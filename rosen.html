        <h1 id="rosen1">THE TRUE MEANING OF BEAUTY</h1>
        <P  class="rosen2">She has got every aspect that defines beauty right with her.when i say she's beautiful, i mean she's beautiful beyond what you are thinking of now. here, am not talking about just the face as you people may take it.below are the aspects i have been talking about that represent this soul am talking about;</P>
    <ol class="rosen3">
        <li>she's got the eyes that everyone looks at and never ceases to look at her longingly</li>
        <li>she's so hardworking to the extent that she at times ends up paying bills which would have been paid by someone else</li>
        <li>she's got a beauty spot just right at the nose which she didnt give to any of her children</li>
        <li>she is also a psychatrist because, most of the times when i was at school and called her via the matron's phone, before i would even tell her that i need something, she would differentiate that i want pocket money or trip money this time not a book or even a text book.</li>
        <li>she's a rolemodel for most of the people because she's a lady who heads a government school but she has developed the school and to your looks, you may think its a private school that she owns</li>
        <li>she's got a naturally nice shaped figure because with all the five children that she bore, she still has the shape that most people think she's young at her 50's </li>
        <li>shes a strong lady who has managed all the five deliveries without surgery and also been there in every situation for dad even when he annoys her</li>
        <li>she's a hero for many people because whenever i move with her, i here people sounding"banange madam, long time! just know am a doctor now!" and some others say "am a headteacher also now!" thanks for the work you did in me, am so grateful my teacher</li>
        <li>she has a pure heart, so loving and caring. she takes care of dad and us in every situation</li>
        <li>i've made this the last because, its what has held her to make it to those aspects above; "SHE IS A PRAYER WARRIOR" I witnessed this when i had done something wrong in her absence and she later on told me everything that happened in her absence. she looked at me and said, "God revealed everything to me in prayer."</li>
